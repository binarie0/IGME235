        On this weather app, you can allow geolocation to get the weather and temperature in your area (accurate within 15 minutes or so.) You can also
        search cities in the search bar and it will automatically find cities/villages/other towns with that name, which you can choose
        by clicking the city you want.
        <br><br>
        Some future goals: Search via zip code, having a button to go back to local location, and stylization with each weather code.
