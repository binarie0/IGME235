        <h2>Beloved Fisherman Tragically Dead</h2>
        <h5 class="date">17 October 2003</h5>
        <p class="subtitle"><b>
            A local Queenstown fisherman, Ronan Owens, was found dead this morning 
            after not returning home and his boat not returning to the dock. The details
            remain fuzzy.
            </b>
        </p>

            Ronan was a family man who worked tirelessly to provide not just for
            his family but for the community. He dedicated his life to fishing locally,
            however on many occasions he would spend his free time fishing on open oceans
            with his family's boat. He also enjoyed hunting expensive and rare fish,
            including swordfish (his family notes his swordfish tacos were phenominal),
            tuna, and seabass.
            <br>
            Sebastian, one of Ronan's good friends, found Ronan this morning. Sebastian
            recounted to news-sources and the police that Ronan did not text him last night
            after saying to Sebastian in the morning that he was "out on open water again, 
            seeing if [he] can catch something big :)". Sebastian initially became curious 
            when the next morning, Ronan's wife called him with a little concern. He headed
            out to the open water docks where he found Ronan's boat slightly away from the dock
            with the sail down and anchor dropped. When he asked for a ride to get closer to the
            boat, he found Ronan face-up laying down in the middle of the boat with multiple
            lacerations and gashes in his stomach.
            <br>
            There is suspected foul play with this scene, considering the multiple
            lacerations that, on police's first glance, were "not caused by anything
            human-made". Questions still remain regarding motive and method, the police
            chief said: "this man had no history of transgressing on anyone and was
            beloved in the community. We will continue to investigate until cause
            of death has been determined and if foul play is involved."
            <br>
            The police have urged the media to let people know about the homicide and
            death tip lines. You can find those on the purple addendum.

            <b>Above: </b>Ronan would always travel with his friend Sebastian from Spain whenever
            they cast on open ocean. Sebastian says he always tells the story about when they
            caught the swordfish pictured above: "Ronan was so focused he almost fell off the boat."

            the blades of the boat's motor were "torn up". Divers examined the hull and the anchor,
            where they found it had sustained damage.
