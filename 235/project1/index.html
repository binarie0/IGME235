            Did extraterrestrials visit Earth in ancient times? Science says not.

            recent close encounters.

            Supporters of the “aliens came here long ago” theory point to ancient
            stories of gods flying in fiery chariots and to pictures of ancient
            rulers in strange garb and headdress, said to be aliens in spacesuits.
            Extraterrestrial visitors arrived with advanced technology to observe
            Earth and perhaps genetically modify its life forms. They helpfully passed
            on some basic technology—such as teaching the Sumerians agriculture
            and math. They also helped build the Pyramids and Stonehenge.
            <br>
            This theory presupposes that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the
            universe. In the 1960s, astrophysicists I. S. Shklovski and Carl Sagan,
            serious scientists and essentially sceptics, judged that extraterrestrials
            were “possible but not proven." Erich Von Daniken on the other hand
            claimed much “evidence” foralien visitors in the art, religion, and
            folklore of many cultures. Zecharia Sitchkin went further, suggesting
            aliens produced modern humans: from a distant planet called Nibiru
            they flew to Earth for minerals and genetically engineered the
            primitive primates they found here to make intelligent workers.
            When the aliens left, discomfited by natural disasters and the last Ice
            Age, humans took over.
            <br>
            In 1952 George Adamski said he met a man from Venus in the
            Colorado Desert of California. The alien, who had long blonde hair,
            used telepathy to talk to Adamski and invited him ona trip to Venus in
            his flying saucer. Adamski was not alone; others, too, claim to have met
            aliens, who visit from planets near and far.

                Scientists believe Venus to be hostile
                to life, thouh Adamski claimed his 
                Venusians lived safely underground.
                Adamski did not believe the first-ever 
                photos of the Barren Far Side of 
                the Moon, taken in 1959 by a Soviet
                spacecraft, saying they'd been faked to
                hide the alien cities that were really 
                there. Life of some kind might exist on
                Mars, but bacteria are unlikely to be
                up to building spacecraft to visit Earth.
