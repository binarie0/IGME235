    <h1>Proposal for Project 3</h1>
    <h2>Name: Ribbit!</h2>
    
    <h3>High Concept</h3>
    <p>
        I wanted this game to be about a frog trying to make it back to the pond. The frog will traverse a bunch of landscapes in order to achieve said goal.
    </p>
    <h3>Genre</h3>
    <p>
        This game will for sure be a platformer. I don't think I'll have enough time to dive more into it and make it a metroidvania or something.
    </p>
    <h3>Platform</h3>
    <p>
        Preferably, anybody on Desktop web will be able to enjoy the game. I think I'd need to figure out how to handle mobile controls since by definition
        they don't have a keyboard.
    </p>
    <h3>Reason for Development</h3>
    <p>
        The story doesn't mean much, unless you want to make it mean something (I won't stop you). 
        <br><br>
        As for the technical aspect, I have a tiny bit of experience building out subsystems for games (I built backend drawing and update calls for MonoGame and Godot projects of mine), so I don't think setting it up will prove too much of a problem. I want to make this just to test my skills,
        especially with a platform and language I'm not used to or 100% comfortable with.
    </p>
    <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <p>
        I want the game to be consisting of pixel art since I think detailed assets would take away from the story a little bit.
    </p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>
        I want the player to have to aim with their mouse and press and hold space to charge up a jump.
    </p>
    <h3>Mockups</h3>
    <p>
        First image is of gameplay, second image is of title screen.

    <h3>About the Developer</h3>
    <p>
        I am Zach, a second-year GDD student and I have a lot of different interests, most of them revolving around coding. I like to code up subsystems and really get into the details of how code functions. I also like to look at the design aspect of apps, like UI Design and UX Testing.
